ðŸŽ¯ Objective:

The Merge Sort algorithm is a divide-and-conquer sorting technique that works by recursively dividing the input array into smaller subarrays, sorting them, and then merging them back together to form a sorted array.

ðŸš€ How it Works:

- Divide the input array into two halves by finding the middle index.
- Recursively apply the Merge Sort algorithm to each half until each half is sorted.
- Merge the two sorted halves by comparing their elements and creating a new sorted array.
- Repeat steps 1-3 until the entire array is sorted.

ðŸŽ“ Advantages:

Efficient for large datasets due to its logarithmic time complexity.

Stable sorting algorithm, meaning that equal elements maintain their relative order.

Suitable for real-time applications with dynamic datasets.

ðŸ”¥ Disadvantages:

Requires additional memory to store the sorted halves during the merge process.

Not as efficient as other sorting algorithms like Quick Sort or Heap Sort for small datasets.
