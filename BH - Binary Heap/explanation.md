ðŸŽ¯ Objective:

Depends on the context.

ðŸš€ How it Works:

- The Heap data structure is a complete binary tree that satisfies the heap property. In a max heap, for any given node i, the value of i is greater than or equal to the values of its children (i.e., the left child i2 + 1 and the right child i2 + 2). In a min heap, the value of i is less than or equal to the values of its children.

- The heap is commonly represented as an array, where the parent-child relationship is derived from the array indices. For any element at index i, the parent is at index (i-1)/2, and the children are at indices 2i + 1 and 2i + 2.

- Heap operations include insertion and deletion of elements. To insert an element, it is added to the end of the array and then "bubbled up" to its correct position. To delete an element, it is replaced by the last element in the array, and then "bubbled down" to its correct position.

ðŸŽ“ Advantages

Heaps provide efficient insertion and deletion operations, as elements are typically added to or removed from the end of the array.

ðŸ”¥ Disadvantages

Heaps do not support efficient search operations for arbitrary elements, as elements may not be stored contiguously in memory.
