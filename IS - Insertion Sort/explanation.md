ðŸŽ¯ Objective:<br>

The Insertion Sort algorithm is a simple sorting technique that builds the final sorted array one element at a time. It maintains a partially sorted subarray at the beginning of the array and iterates through the unsorted portion, inserting each element into its correct position within the sorted subarray.<br>

ðŸš€ How it Works:<br>

Start with the second element (index 1) and consider it as the key to be inserted into the sorted subarray.
Compare the key with the elements in the sorted subarray, moving larger elements to the right to make space for the key.
Insert the key into the correct position within the sorted subarray.
Repeat steps 1-3 for the remaining unsorted elements until the entire array is sorted.<br>

ðŸŽ“ Advantages:<br>

Simple and easy to implement.<br>
Efficient for small datasets or nearly sorted arrays.<br>

ðŸ”¥ Disadvantages:<br>

Inefficient for large datasets due to its quadratic time complexity.<br>
Not suitable for real-time applications with dynamic datasets.<br>
Remember, the Insertion Sort algorithm is particularly effective for small datasets or situations where elements are frequently added to an already partially sorted array.
