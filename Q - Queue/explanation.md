ðŸŽ¯ Objective:

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, meaning that the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed.

ðŸš€ How it Works:

- A queue is commonly represented as an array or a linked list, where elements are added to the end of the structure and removed from the front. The front of the queue is the element that will be removed next, and the rear is the element that was most recently added.

- Queue operations include insertion and deletion of elements. To insert an element, it is added to the rear of the queue. To delete an element, it is removed from the front of the queue.

ðŸŽ“ Advantages:

Queues provide efficient insertion and deletion operations, as elements are typically added to or removed from the ends of the array or linked list. This makes queues well-suited for scenarios where elements need to be processed in the order they were added.

ðŸ”¥ Disadvantages:

Queues do not support efficient search operations for arbitrary elements, as elements may not be stored contiguously in memory. Additionally, queues do not have a constant-time access to the last element added, as opposed to a stack.

It's important to note that in some cases, the queue can be implemented using a circular array, this allows the queue to grow dynamically, and it's more efficient than a linear array-based implementation when the queue size is not fixed.
