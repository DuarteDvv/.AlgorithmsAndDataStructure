ðŸŽ¯ Objective:<br>

Binary Search is a highly efficient searching algorithm that works on a sorted array. It utilizes the divide-and-conquer strategy to quickly locate a target element within the array.

ðŸš€ How it Works:<br>

- Determine the middle element of the array.
- Compare the middle element with the target element.
- If they match, the search is successful, and the index is returned.
- If the target element is less than the middle element, repeat the search on the left half of the array.
- If the target element is greater than the middle element, repeat the search on the right half of the array.
- Continue dividing the array and repeating the process until the target element is found or the search range becomes empty.<br>

ðŸŽ“ Advantages:

Highly efficient on sorted arrays.<br>
Reduces the search range by half in each iteration.<br>

ðŸ”¥ Disadvantages:

Requires a sorted array as input.<br>
Inefficient for unsorted arrays.<br>
May not find all occurrences of the target element in duplicate scenarios.
