ðŸŽ¯ Objective:<br>
The Bubble Sort algorithm is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly passes through the array to verify and correct the order. It compares adjacent elements and swaps them if necessary. This process is repeated until the array is sorted.

ðŸš€ How it Works:<br>
The algorithm starts at the initial position of the array and compares the current element with the next one. If the current element is larger than the next one, they are swapped. Otherwise, the position of the current element is maintained, and the process is repeated with the next element. This process continues until the entire array has been checked. Then, the algorithm starts a new pass through the array, repeating the process until all passes are completed.

ðŸŽ“ Advantages

Easy to understand and implement.<br>
Requires little memory, as the only extra memory needed for the algorithm is for the control variables.


ðŸ”¥ Disadvantages

Inefficient runtime.<br>
The number of element swaps in the worst case is approximately O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the array.
